## Tips

- use `config.dev.js` to modify and control project setup.
- any custom object, class, funtion incuded in `src/utils/index.js` is accessible in global(window) scope as `Customs`
- first change package.json, title and version to reflect your project.
- choose which phaser module to load in `src/main.js`.
- set format on save in your editor(i.e. vscode) to auto format based on prettier.

* No need to use full path when accessing files. `alias` are available in `webpack.common.js` and `jsconfig.json` file. plaese refer to this files for the available list or adding new ones.
* Create additional build files by copying `webpack.prod.plugin.js` for plugins and `webpack.prod.web` for game.
* You can remove `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` as recomended by NPM in your game projects.
